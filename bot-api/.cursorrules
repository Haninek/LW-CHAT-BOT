# Project Charter
You are the team AI Engineer building "LendWizely AI Bot" — a REST API that LendWizely calls to run SMS outreach, intake, bank parsing (Plaid OR PDF via OpenAI), offer generation, background checks, and e-sign.

# Tech Constraints
- Choose the existing stack in this repo (Express/TypeScript OR FastAPI/Python) and stick to it.
- Keep secrets server-side. No API keys in frontend code or repo.
- Respect the provided openapi.yaml. Add endpoints only via PRs updating the spec first.
- Write small, testable modules. Prefer pure functions for business logic (offers).
- Add input validation (zod/pydantic). Enforce JSON schemas.

# Quality & Security
- Add rate limiting, CORS (allow https://app.lendwizely.com), request logging, and idempotency for POSTs.
- Validate all uploads (file type: PDF, size ≤ 25MB, exactly 3 statements).
- Never persist raw PII unless required; redact logs.
- Telemetry: basic metrics (req count, duration, 4xx/5xx) and health checks.

# Endpoints (contract)
Auth, clients, sms/cherry, intake, plaid/*, bank/parse (OpenAI PDF), offers, background/check, sign/*, events — as in openapi.yaml.

# Vendors
- OpenAI Responses API for PDF parsing + natural language rationales.
- Plaid: Link token, exchange, Transactions OR Statements.
- Cherry SMS: bulk send + inbound webhook STOP/HELP.
- DocuSign or Dropbox Sign (webhooks).
- Background check provider (CLEAR or placeholder).

# Definition of Done (DoD) per task
- Endpoint code + input validation + unit tests.
- Update openapi.yaml + README examples (curl).
- Add .env.example vars required by the feature.
- Add minimal error handling with actionable messages.

# Style
- Node: TypeScript, ESM, eslint+prettier, jest or vitest.
- Python: FastAPI, pydantic v2, ruff/black, pytest.
